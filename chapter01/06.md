# Problem 1.6

When is a directed graph a category?


## Solution

Status: **PARTIALLY SOLVED**

Fully connected directed graph is a categoty.

### TODO: other solutions

There are clearly other, not fully-connected, graphs which are categories.

For example, for number of vertecies is 3, and the following morphisms defined:

```
1 -> 2
1 -> 3
2 -> 3
```

we have a graph which is clearly a category.
