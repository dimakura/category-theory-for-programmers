# Problem 1.5

Is Facebook a category, with people as objects and friendships as morphisms?

## Solution

No. Facebook is not a category.

Let's take people P1, P2, and P3 where P1 and P2 are friends, and so are P2 and P3, but P1 and P3 are not friends. Because we clearly have morphisms P1 -> P2 and P2 -> P3, there should be a morphism P1 -> P3. Facebook provides us with such morphism, called "friend-of-friend"! Therefore we have a morphism P1 -> P3 (not a direct friendship, but "friend-of-friend").
Now let's take a new person P4, who is friend only to the P3, but not to P1 and P2. Because we have morphisms P1 -> P3 and P3 -> P4, there MUST be morphism P1 -> P4. But there's none! Unless Facebook (in the future) will provide us with a morphisms of "friend-of-friend-of-friend"; but even in such case we can continue ad-infinitum, thus exhausting every finite chains of friendship relationships.
