# Problem 1.5

Is Facebook a category, with people as objects and friendships as morphisms?


## Solution

No. Facebook is not a category.

To see this, let's consider people P1, P2, and P3. Let's also assume that P1 and P2 are friends, and so are P2 and P3, but P1 and P3 are not friends.

Because we have morphisms (friendships) P1 -> P2 and P2 -> P3, there should be a morphism P1 -> P3. Facebook provides us with such morphism, called "friend-of-friend"! Therefore we have a morphism P1 -> P3 (not a direct friendship, but "friend-of-friend"). So far Facebook looks like a category.

But let's now consider one more person P4, who is a friend only to the P3, but not to P1 and P2.

Because we have morphisms P1 -> P3 (frined-of-friend) and P3 -> P4 (friend), there MUST be morphism P1 -> P4. But there's none! Unless Facebook (in the future) will provide us with a morphisms called "friend-of-friend-of-friend"; but even in such case we can continue adding new people to our chain to exhaus any finite depth of friendship relationships.
